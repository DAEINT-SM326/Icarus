“Never regret thy fall, 
O Icarus of the fearless flight
For the greatest tragedy of them all
Is never to feel the burning light.”

Icarus is Daedalus Initiative's main Guilded bot. The features of this bot have yet to be completely defined, but some of the initial features are as follows:
    Providing Fleetyards data
    Providing Star Citizen game data from scunpacked
    Notifying users when Star Citizen posts are posted
    Notifying users when Star Citizen updates are released
    
After these initial features are complete, further needed features will be discussed with the community.
